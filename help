replicaset vs replication controller:
	- replicaset has property "selector"
	- replicaset take care of matching pods (in selector), even if they were created before.
	- replicaset is replacement for replication controller
	- template:

		apiVersion: apps/v1
		kind: ReplicaSet
		metadata:
			name: myapp-replicaset
			labels:
				app: myapp
				type: myapp-type
		spec:
			template:
				\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
				\\POD TEMPLATE HERE\\
				\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
			replicas: n
			selector:
				\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
				\\matchLabels - matchExpressions      \\
				\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

				matchLabels:
					type: mypod-type // -> Match the labels of pod in template

	

deployment:
	- deployment create replicaset -> pods
	- features:
		- rolling update
		- rollback
	- deployment strategy:
		- Recreate
		- Rolling update (default)
	- arch:
		deployment[ 
			replicaset[ 
				pods
			] 
		]
	- template:

		apiVersion: apps/v1
		kind: Deployment
		metadata:
			name: myapp-deployment
			labels:

					maxUnavailable: 25%



basic commands:
	- help:
		kubectl explain pod
		kubectl explain replicaset
		kubectl create deployment --help



	kubectl create -f xxx.yml
	kubectl replace -f xxx.yml

	kubectl get all

	kubectl get pods
	kubectl delete pod myapp-pod
	kubectl describe pod myapp-pod

	kubectl get replicaset
	kubectl describe replicaset myapp-replicaset
	kubectl scale --replicas=6 -f xxx.yml
	kubectl delete replicaset myapp-replicaset


	kubectl create -f xxx.yml --record
		=> record option instructs K8s to record the cause of change in deployment's revision
	kubectl get deployments
	kubectl describe deployment myapp-deployment
	kubectl rollout status deployment/myapp-deployment
	kubectl rollout history deployment/myapp-deployment
		=> show revision and history of deployment
	
	kubectl aplpy -f xxx.yml
		=> apply the change to deployment (docker image's version,...)
	kubectl rollout undo deployment/myapp-deployment
		=> rollback to previous version
