Docker Notes:


ENTRYPOIT VS CMD:
- CMD:
	ex:
		FROM Ubuntu
		CMD ["sleep","5"]

	docker build -t ubuntu-sleeper .
	
	run with built-in CMD:
		docker run ubuntu-sleeper
			=> container run with built-in CMD "sleep 5" 
			=> run for 5s and stop
	overide built-in CMD:
		docker run ubuntu-sleeper sleep 10
			=> container run with overide CMD "sleep 10" 
			=> run for 10s and stop

- ENTRYPOINT: use with args
	ex:
		FROM Ubuntu
		ENTRYPOINT ["sleep"]

	run with arg passed to ENTRYPOINT:
		docker run ubuntu-sleeper 10
			=> container run with arg appended to ENTRYPOINT "sleep 10" 
	run without arg:
		docker run ubuntu-sleeper
			=> error

- Combine CMD with ENTRYPOINT
	ex:
		FROM Ubuntu
		ENTRYPOINT ["sleep"]
		CMD ["5"]

	run with arg passed to ENTRYPOINT:
		docker run ubuntu-sleeper 10
			=> container run with arg appended to ENTRYPOINT "sleep 10" 
	run without arg:
		docker run ubuntu-sleeper
			=> container run with CMD appended to ENTRYPOINT "sleep 5" 

	when we want to override ENTRYPOINT to another instruction:
		docker run --entrypoint sleep2.0 ubuntu-sleeper 10
			=> container run with arg appended to overrided ENTRYPOINT "sleep2.0 10"
